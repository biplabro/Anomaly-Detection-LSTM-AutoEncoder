### Error Patterns

1. Create different waveforms like sine, square, sawtooth etc.
2. Insert the values into the anomaly_ev.csv dataset
3. Test the LSTM algo with different curves as error trend and see the response

```
**Below method is discarded**

### Distribution curves test

Purpose:

1. Generate different curves
2. Convert the numpy array if required
3. Fit the data inside the specific column of anomaly_ev.csv dataset
4. Test the LSTM algo with different curves as error trend and see the response
